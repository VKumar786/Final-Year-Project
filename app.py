        **Methodology:**
        The following machine learning algorithms were used in this project:
        - Support Vector Machine (SVM).
        - Random Forest.
        
        **Algorithm Selection:**
        - Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was chosen for its robustness in handling complex datasets and its ability to find optimal decision boundaries. SVM performs well in high-dimensional spaces and is effective in cases where the data may not be linearly separable.
        - Random Forest, on the other hand, was selected for its ensemble learning approach, which combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. It is capable of handling large datasets with high dimensionality and is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
        
        **Technology Used:**
        This web application was developed using Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating interactive web applications.
